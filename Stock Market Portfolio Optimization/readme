📈 Stock Market Portfolio Optimization
This project demonstrates how to build an optimized stock portfolio using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). The goal is to analyze historical stock data, calculate returns and volatility, simulate thousands of portfolios, and identify the one that maximizes the Sharpe Ratio — offering the best risk-adjusted return.
