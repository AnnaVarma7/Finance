🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict real estate prices based on proximity to amenities and geographic location. It explores feature impacts, visual patterns, and model performance using linear regression.

🎯 Objective
Estimate house price per unit area using relevant real estate features
Identify key factors influencing property valuation
Build and evaluate a predictive regression model

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python
Pandas – Data handling
Seaborn & Matplotlib – Data visualization
Scikit-learn – Model training and evaluation

📁 Dataset Overview
File: Real_Estate.csv

Features include:
Transaction date
House age
Distance to the nearest MRT station
Number of convenience stores
Latitude, Longitude

House price of unit area (Target)

🧪 Steps Followed
1. Data Preprocessing
Checked for missing values (none found)
Explored distributions using histograms
Converted date formats and extracted temporal features if needed (not used in modeling)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Scatter plots revealed:
Negative correlation between house price and MRT distance
Positive correlation with number of nearby convenience stores
Correlation matrix confirmed:
Strongest factor: Distance to MRT station (-0.64)
Moderate factor: Number of convenience stores (0.28)

3. Model Building
Algorithm: Linear Regression
Features used:
Distance to MRT
Number of convenience stores
Latitude, Longitude
Target: House price per unit area
Train/Test Split: 80/20

4. Model Evaluation
Visualized predicted vs actual prices
Reasonable accuracy for most points, though some outliers exist
Performance can be further improved with advanced models (e.g., Random Forests)

📊 Key Insights
Properties closer to MRT stations have significantly higher prices
Local amenities (stores) also positively influence price
Age of the house has minimal impact on pricing in this dataset
Geographic coordinates provide spatial context but limited predictive power alone

💡 Future Enhancements
Include more features like floor area, number of rooms, year built
Use ensemble models (XGBoost, Random Forest) for better accuracy
Apply geospatial clustering or heatmaps for location-based insights
